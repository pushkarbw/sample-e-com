**Browser Compatibility Issue:** Flexbox justify-content: space-between calculations differ between browsers when items wrap to new lines. Safari may distribute remaining space differently than Chrome/Firefox, especially when flex items have varying content. Edge browser historically had different flex-wrap behavior.

#### Test: "4BDCF should handle viewport units with consistent behavior"
**Browser Compatibility Issue:** Viewport units (vh, vw) support and calculation differences between browsers. Mobile Safari treats viewport units differently than other mobile browsers, particularly with dynamic viewport changes. Android browsers may handle viewport units inconsistently.

#### Test: "4BDCF should handle CSS filters with graceful degradation"
**Browser Compatibility Issue:** CSS filter property support varies widely. Internet Explorer doesn't support CSS filters. Safari and Firefox may render filter effects with different performance characteristics. Older browsers require fallback opacity effects.

#### Test: "4BDCF should handle backdrop blur effects with fallback behavior"
**Browser Compatibility Issue:** Backdrop-filter property has limited browser support. Only supported in newer Chrome/Safari versions. Firefox doesn't support backdrop-filter. Requires fallback to regular background colors or alternative blur techniques.

## 5NF Network API Failure Test Suite

### Test File: `/client/selenium/e2e/02-core-shopping/5nf-network-api-failures.js`

**5NF should validate product grid when API returns empty** - Test expects products to display from cache/local storage when products API returns empty response, but implementation may not have offline capability leading to blank product grid

**5NF should handle search results when API is unavailable** - Test assumes search functionality continues working with cached data when search API fails, but search may be entirely dependent on backend calls

**5NF should add to cart when backend is unreachable** - Test expects cart operations to work locally when cart API is down, but cart state may be strictly server-side managed causing add operations to fail silently

**5NF should update cart quantities when API times out** - Test assumes quantity updates can be processed optimistically when update API times out, but implementation may require server confirmation before UI updates

**5NF should complete checkout form when order API is down** - Test expects checkout process to continue and show confirmation when order creation API fails, but checkout may be tightly coupled to backend order processing

**5NF should validate payment method when payment API fails** - Test assumes payment form validation works independently when payment service is unavailable, but validation logic may depend on real-time payment gateway checks

**5NF should handle stock check when inventory API returns malformed data** - Test expects add-to-cart functionality to remain enabled when stock API returns invalid data, but implementation may disable purchasing when stock validation fails

**5NF should process bulk cart operations when batch API fails** - Test assumes bulk operations fall back to individual API calls when batch service is down, but implementation may not have fallback mechanism for batch operations

### Test File: `/client/selenium/e2e/02-core-shopping/5nf-cart-network-dependencies.js`

**5NF should display cart items when sync API returns empty response** - Test expects locally cached cart items to display when cart sync API returns empty, but cart display may depend entirely on server response

**5NF should handle cart item removal when delete API is unresponsive** - Test assumes optimistic UI updates for item removal when delete API hangs, but removal may require server confirmation before UI changes

**5NF should proceed with checkout when shipping calculation fails** - Test expects default shipping options to display when shipping API is unavailable, but checkout may block without shipping calculations

**5NF should complete order when payment gateway times out** - Test assumes order completion with retry options when payment processing times out, but implementation may prevent order creation without payment confirmation

**5NF should allow adding out-of-stock items when stock API fails** - Test expects normal shopping flow when stock validation service is down, but add-to-cart may be disabled without stock verification

**5NF should handle cart persistence when session API is interrupted** - Test assumes cart state preservation when session validation fails, but cart may be cleared on authentication issues

### Test File: `/client/selenium/e2e/02-core-shopping/cart-checkout.js` (Updated)

**5NF should handle cart operations when API returns malformed JSON** - Test expects cart display to work with local data when cart API returns invalid response structure, but cart rendering may depend on specific API response format

**5NF should proceed with checkout when order creation API fails** - Test assumes checkout completion with local order number generation when order API is down, but checkout may require server-side order processing

**5NF should display cart total when calculation API is down** - Test expects local total calculation when cart total API fails, but pricing calculations may be strictly server-side for accuracy

### Test File: `/client/selenium/e2e/03-api-integration/api-integration.js` (Updated)

**5NF should handle product search when backend returns corrupted data** - Test expects search results to display cached data when search API returns malformed response, but search may fail entirely with invalid API responses

**5NF should authenticate user when auth service returns partial data** - Test assumes successful login with fallback user data when auth API returns incomplete user information, but authentication may require complete user profile data

**5NF should display cart when inventory API provides inconsistent stock data** - Test expects normal cart operations when stock API returns negative/invalid values, but cart functionality may be disabled with unreliable inventory data

**5NF should complete checkout when payment validation API times out** - Test assumes checkout completion with payment processing status when validation API is slow, but payment validation may be required before order creation

**5NF should handle order history when database connection is unstable** - Test expects order page to display meaningful content with retry options when orders API is intermittent, but order history may show error states instead of graceful degradation

## Network Failure Simulation Strategy

These tests simulate realistic API outage scenarios by:
- Mocking fetch responses to return empty/malformed data instead of proper API responses
- Creating timeouts and hanging promises to simulate slow/unresponsive services  
- Providing inconsistent data structures that break expected API contracts
- Testing optimistic UI updates vs server-dependent operations
- Validating graceful degradation vs hard failure modes

The failures are designed to expose dependencies on real-time API connectivity that may not be apparent during normal testing with stable backend services.
